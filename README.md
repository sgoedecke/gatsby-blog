Hello! This is the repository for my personal website, hosted at www.seangoedecke.com.

You should probably read the content via the website, but if for whatever reason you prefer to consume it as markdown, you're welcome to read it here.

Note that files in drafts/ are often very rough and do not represent my considered opinions.

Why Gatsby? Because ~7 years ago when I created this repository I was using Gatsby to rebuild https://developer.zendesk.com/documentation/, and I thought this would be a good way to learn it. I would choose something dramatically simpler if I were setting up my blog today.

I do not check notifications on this repository. If you'd like me to look at your issue or merge your PR, you're better off emailing me.
