I’m passionate about making things faster and more reliable. I love refactoring (or better yet, removing) technical debt, and designing systems that can be flexible without accumulating much technical debt in the first place. I care deeply about how my systems run in production.

I’ve worked at scale with Rails, Ruby, Golang, and Javascript. In my own time, I write personal projects in Go, Python and Crystal.
