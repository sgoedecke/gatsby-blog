I recently wrote an [article](https://leaddev.com/technical-direction/vibe-coding-hype-cycles-why-ai-isnt-10x-answer) for LeadDev about how software engineers are dealing with the AI hype in practice. Here's my position, in short:

I think AI is pretty great. It speeds me up[^1] by about 50% overall - in practice, sometimes 0% and sometimes 300%, depending on what I'm working on. I have to do gnarly legacy changes myself, since there's way too much [wicked context](/wicked-features) for the AI to consume. But if I'm making a change in a small, fairly isolated codebase, Copilot Agent mode can get me 90% of the way there.

The problem is that tech leaders are expecting a consistent 10x speedup, not the 1.5x speedup I'm getting. When they vibe code things, they're always working on greenfield projects where AI is most effective - or they're not doing the last 10% that you'd actually need to get a brownfield change into production. It's hard to explain that AI still can't do the hardest parts of the job.

And I'm having a comparatively easy time, since AI works well for me. My colleagues who are AI skeptics or dislike it on [moral grounds](/is-ai-wrong) are under much more pressure. They're fighting on two fronts: against leadership's new AI mandates, while also struggling to review the tide of partially AI-generated code that their AI-friendly colleagues are generating. There's a lot of internal conflict in the industry right now, which is especially tough now that [layoffs are much more common](/good-times-are-over).

If you want to read much more about this, you can check out the [article](https://leaddev.com/technical-direction/vibe-coding-hype-cycles-why-ai-isnt-10x-answer). But I wanted to note my position down in a more unpolished way here.
