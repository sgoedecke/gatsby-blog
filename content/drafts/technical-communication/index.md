Writing is a big part of the job. This is more true the more senior you get - in the limit case, a principal or distinguished engineer might only write technical documents - but even brand-new junior engineers need to write.

Engineers write in many different places: commit messages, code comments, PR descriptions and comments, Slack threads, internal announcements, documentation, runbooks, and so on. **Whether you write well or badly matters a lot.**

Technical writing is not like many other kinds of writing. There's very little art to it. Like code, it's typically not a good thing if your style or voice is too unique. But like code, there is a lot of _craft_ to it.

The most important thing about technical writing is that **you are almost never going to communicate everything successfully**. You may have a crystal-clear understanding of what you're talking about, but your reader will not. They won't have the context you have. They likely won't have the _interest_ you have: if you're writing a paragraph to try and ask some other team to do something, that something is your project that you (presumably) care about, but the other team has their own projects and will probably only skim what you wrote.

You thus have to write like a signwriter, not a poet. Don't write for readers who are going to really dig into the nuances of your work. Write for readers who are going to glance at your work while they hustle by on the way to something else. That has a few consequences for how you structure your writing:

- Put what you're asking the reader to do right [up front](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BLUF_(communication)).
