Writing is a big part of the job. This is more true the more senior you get - in the limit case, a principal or distinguished engineer might only write technical documents. But even brand-new junior engineers need to write: commit messages, code comments, PR descriptions and comments, Slack threads, internal announcements, documentation, runbooks, and so on. **Whether you write well or badly matters a lot.**

Technical writing is not like many other kinds of writing. There's very little art to it. Like code, it's typically not a good thing if your style or voice is too unique. But like code, there is a lot of _craft_ to it.

### Context asymmetry

The most important thing about technical writing is that **you are almost always communicating to people with less technical context than you**. You may have a crystal-clear understanding of what you're talking about, but your reader will not.

They likely won't even be as interested as you in the topic: if you're writing a paragraph to try and ask some other team to do something, that something is your project that you (presumably) care about, but the other team has their own projects and will probably only skim what you wrote.

### Front-load the information

**Put what you're asking the reader to do right [up front](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BLUF_(communication)).** You thus have to write like a signwriter, not a poet. Don't write for readers who are going to really dig into the nuances of your work. Write for readers who are going to glance at your work while they hustle by on the way to something else.
