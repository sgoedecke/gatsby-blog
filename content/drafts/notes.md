### Hedgehogs and foxes

In 1941, Joseph Juran coined the Pareto Principle: that df. In 1953 Isaiah Berlin popularized the idea that "a fox knows many things, but a hedgehog knows one big thing"[^1].

**When I work on engineering projects, I am a hedgehog.** The one big thing I know is that the project has to ship. As the project goes on, I am monomaniacal about this: every conversation, every planning meeting, every PR and PR review is understood in the context of the project deadline and the remaining blockers for the project. I start every workday by asking myself "could the project ship today" and then working through all the reasons why it can't.

**I don't worry about details that won't affect whether the project can ship.** If there's a bug that isn't scary enough to delay the ship or a missing feature that isn't important enough to delay the ship, I don't work on them until everyhing that could possibly delay the ship is taken care of. Some engineers spend a lot of time sketching out things that would be cool if they existed, or future redesigns that users might love. I do that too, but _not when I'm leading projects_. When I'm leading projects, I only know that the project has to ship.

This is not so much a considered position as it is a character trait. In general, I try to make the big decisions correctly and let the small ones worry about themselves. For instance, when it comes to finances I spend a lot of time thinking about increasing or maintaining my main source of income, and a lot of time thinking about big expenses (e.g. housing). I spend almost no time thinking about small purchases, or about making/saving small amounts of money (e.g. rewards programs, clothing).

The downside to this is I consistently leave some value on the table. I probably should use the rewards program at the supermarket when I buy groceries. I probably should spend two days tweaking my VSCode config to be nicer, since for the last five years I've been using default themes and plugins.

### I enjoy making pragmatic deecisions

[^1]: Berlin was talking about philosophers who have a big overarching idea or theory (like Plato) and philosophers who don't (like Aristotle). The line is originally a fragment of the Ancient Greek poet Archilocus. [Who knows what he was talking about.](https://www.jstor.org/stable/636782?read-now=1&refreqid=excelsior%3A28c2e651b431a8e3db40e457c44d4cae&seq=4#page_scan_tab_contents)




### I enjoy making tradeoffs

* I like making pragmatic decisions - I feel like this can be painful for some devs, but I genuinely enjoy it
* I'm good at carving out time for myself even while under pressure, so (at least so far) I'm pretty resistant to burnout
* When I do the first 80% of something, I actually do the first 80%: i.e. enough that you could actually ship it (albeit a little unpolished), not just enough so that the happy path is demoable
* I don't emotionally invest in any implementation, so I'm happy to pivot on a dime and keep moving



why can't ais have new ideas?

how projects fail at large tech companies
 -- doomed from the start (bad plan, or over-ambitious with not wide enough support)
 -- change of leadership (esp for multi year projects)
 -- just bad luck, a bet that didn't pan out
 -- no leadership or early success, so flail until killed
 -- one high profile mistake taints the whole thing (e.g. bad availability incident)
 -- lack of commitment, not enough weight thrown behind a promising start
 -- death by a thousand cuts - initial good idea diluted by mandatory changes from people who don't get it or don't really care, eventually the original good idea haver leaves in disgust. - idea here is you need lots of buy in to get something off the ground, but people buy in for their own reasons which always comes with strings


caring an unreasonable amount about software

good engineers write bad code

how good engineers annoy their managers

legibility vs depth. in war rooms, need high legibility. investigations need depth 
but are opaque. I investigated m1

you had better be happy with the vision of large companies delivering marginal improvements, because that's the only time a high-quality software world for webdev can be sustainable. otherwise it's inefficient, which means eventually it will stop

how I assess engineers - man, that's a great point I didn't think of

In it, you make a point that having a weak manager without political clout is bad news. 

While I think it's obvious for some, I'd love for that full, follow up post on how to navigate having a weak manager with a reputation while being a strong engineer.

System design tips

Staying in the code. Close to the metal. What happens when you drift away

P.S. In case you need another blog post idea. I was wondering if you have advice on how to handle situations where you can dig further at product requirements that aren't owned by your team in order to reduce the complexity of the requirements onto your team? I mean I think the short answer is some list like

Pros

If you succeed, you have less requirements / a simpler system to maintain.
Even if you don't succeed, you will learn a bit about the system as a whole.

Cons

Even if you succeed, you might be in a position where people now think you own that product requirement when you don't.
It takes time that you could be spending elsewhere and given how it isn't in your domain, you are probably not doing product digging that efficiently. That said you might have the most context as to what kind of questions are important to get answered.
The real product owner might not be happy about you intruding into their domain.

I think maybe this is also summarized by what you said about how you should do glue work tactically for the projects you lead.
