why people hate AI? it's the connection with art
the crypto NFT insistence that 'this is the future of art' about obvious shit
avoiding ARC Raiders because of AI use... well, almost every piece of software you use has had AI contribute, many institutions you interact with have ChatGPT assistance, etc
why do people not boycott that? is it just lack of visibility? or is it that people don't want to be put directly in contact with AI output?

classifier didn't work great - same problem, more or less
what if you heavily constrain sampling?
 What if we started by training a tiny model, then once the loss rate stalls, increase
  the model size and continue, etc? Would that work?

can you improve 5 min training by training a quick classifier for TTC?
maybe?
is it cheating to generate a training set for the classifier outside of the 5 min window
I don't think so, within the rules
