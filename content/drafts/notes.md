caring an unreasonable amount about software

good engineers write bad code

legibility vs depth. in war rooms, need high legibility. investigations need depth 
but are opaque. I investigated m1

you had better be happy with the vision of large companies delivering marginal improvements, because that's the only time a high-quality software world for webdev can be sustainable. otherwise it's inefficient, which means eventually it will stop

how I assess engineers - man, that's a great point I didn't think of

In it, you make a point that having a weak manager without political clout is bad news. 

While I think it's obvious for some, I'd love for that full, follow up post on how to navigate having a weak manager with a reputation while being a strong engineer.

System design tips

Staying in the code. Close to the metal. What happens when you drift away

P.S. In case you need another blog post idea. I was wondering if you have advice on how to handle situations where you can dig further at product requirements that aren't owned by your team in order to reduce the complexity of the requirements onto your team? I mean I think the short answer is some list like

Pros

If you succeed, you have less requirements / a simpler system to maintain.
Even if you don't succeed, you will learn a bit about the system as a whole.

Cons

Even if you succeed, you might be in a position where people now think you own that product requirement when you don't.
It takes time that you could be spending elsewhere and given how it isn't in your domain, you are probably not doing product digging that efficiently. That said you might have the most context as to what kind of questions are important to get answered.
The real product owner might not be happy about you intruding into their domain.

I think maybe this is also summarized by what you said about how you should do glue work tactically for the projects you lead.
