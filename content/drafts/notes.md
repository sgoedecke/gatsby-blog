how I assess engineers - man, that's a great point I didn't think of

In it, you make a point that having a weak manager without political clout is bad news. 

While I think it's obvious for some, I'd love for that full, follow up post on how to navigate having a weak manager with a reputation while being a strong engineer.

System design tips

Staying in the code. Close to the metal. What happens when you drift away

P.S. In case you need another blog post idea. I was wondering if you have advice on how to handle situations where you can dig further at product requirements that aren't owned by your team in order to reduce the complexity of the requirements onto your team? I mean I think the short answer is some list like

Pros

If you succeed, you have less requirements / a simpler system to maintain.
Even if you don't succeed, you will learn a bit about the system as a whole.

Cons

Even if you succeed, you might be in a position where people now think you own that product requirement when you don't.
It takes time that you could be spending elsewhere and given how it isn't in your domain, you are probably not doing product digging that efficiently. That said you might have the most context as to what kind of questions are important to get answered.
The real product owner might not be happy about you intruding into their domain.

I think maybe this is also summarized by what you said about how you should do glue work tactically for the projects you lead.

## Building your sense of what's important

all kinds of work. most of it is minor. occasional pieces are v important
some people never start thinking about this in big tech
for me, the spark was lab day
you'll get it wrong, but it gets better over time

## Impact and cowardice

not caring about political influence is cowardly
no losers on successful teams and vice versa: https://cacm.acm.org/opinion/life-lessons-from-the-first-half-century-of-my-career/ - if you don't care about making your team successful, you're undercutting more junior engineers. gain clout and use it!
your team will get sidelined and eventually get canned if you don't build power. maybe that's fine for you, senior engineer, but it screws over the more junior people on your team who need accomplishments and can't roll into another job
if you're able to do politically valuable work, you have a responsibility to your team to do it

strong engineers, weak engineers, managers, PMs, executives, interns

### Is there no such thing as strong engineers, just strong teams?

I want to address a common belief in the ZIRP era (now less prevalent) that strong engineers are only strong in the context of the team, because it's the team that enables an engineer to succeed. According to this view, it doesn't make sense to talk about how some engineers are more effective than others, because the root cause of this effectiveness is always processes at the team level (i.e. systems that produce high psychological safety). I've spent some time working in an environment like this, which was frustrating for a few reasons.

First, everyone who was actually invested in getting stuff done was quietly playing their own game of "shuffle the competent engineers onto my project". But you couldn't actually say "I think this engineer should come and work on X, because it's hard and they're really good". You had to communicate as if it somehow just made more organizational sense for the engineer you wanted to work on your project.

Moderately difficult engineering tasks became near-impossible, since it was mandatory to break them down into well-documented pieces that even the least effective engineer on the team could pick up and accomplish. That meant either covertly making sure the few hard pieces were picked up by the right engineers, or doing the work yourself ahead of time and then writing maximally-granular tasks like "add this function here with this code in it". The first solution is politically hard, since you can't talk about it; the second is technically hard, because you can't make changes mid-implementation like you would if you were actually doing the work.

I don't want to be too negative about this view. The health of a team does have a big impact on how well an engineer can perform. It might even be worth spending most of your time on this as a manager, since you probably can't magically turn weak engineers into workhorses or workhorses into strong engineers. But the extreme version of this view - that there are no weak or strong engineers, just weak or strong teams - is clearly false.
