Much of the complexity is produced by a small set of what I call "wicked features", which interfere with _every other_ feature. For instance, adding a whole new user type: once you do that, you have to ask "can this user type access this feature" for every feature for the rest of the company's life. Adding a new deployment environment is a popular example of this (for instance, offering your cloud-based SaaS as an on-premise deployment). Unfortunately, these features are often the most lucrative by far, because they unlock huge enterprise customers. So big tech companies often have multiple wicked features.

Incidentally, this is why the quality of big tech engineering is sometimes worse than you would expect. The cognitive load of operating in this environment is pretty intense. Delivering anything at all is [really, really difficult](/how-to-ship). So really obvious balls sometimes get dropped because the engineer in question was trying to thread a path between ten other features.
