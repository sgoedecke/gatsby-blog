The key idea of [_The Dictator's Handbook_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Dictator%27s_Handbook) - a popular political science book by Bruce Bueno de Mesquita and Alastair Smith - can be expressed in three points.

### What does the book say?

- When explaining how organizations[^1] behave, it is more useful to consider the motivations of individual people (say, the leader) than "the organization" as a whole
- Every leader must depend upon a coalition of insiders who help them maintain their position
- Almost every feature of organizations can be explained by the ratio between the size of three groups:
  - The members of the **coalition** (i.e. the "inner circle")
  - The group who could conceivably become members of the coalition (the "outer circle", or what the book calls the "interchangeables")
  - The entire population who is subject to the leader

For instance, take an autocratic dictator. That dictator depends on a tiny group of people to maintain power: military generals, some powerful administrators, and so on. There is a larger group of people who could be in the inner circle but aren't: for instance, other generals or administrators who are involved in government but aren't fully trusted. Then there is the much, much larger group of all residents of the country, who are affected by the leader's policies but have no ability to control them. This is an example of **small-coalition** government.

Alternatively, take a democratic president. To maintain power, the president depends on every citizen who is willing to vote for them. There's a larger group of people outside that core coalition: voters who aren't supporters of the president, but could conceivably be persuaded. Finally, there's the inhabitants of the country who do not vote: non-citizens, the very young, potentially felons, and so on. This is an example of **large-coalition** government.

Mesquita and Smith argue that the structure of the government is downstream from the coalition sizes. If the coalition is small, it doesn't matter whether the country is nominally a democracy - it will function like an autocratic dicatorship. Likewise, if the coalition is large, even a dictatorship will act in the best interests of its citizens (and will necessarily democratize).

According to them, the structure of government does not change the size of the coalition. Rather, changes in the size of the coalition force changes in the structure of government. For instance, a democratic leader may want to shrink the size of their coalition to make it easier to hold onto power (e.g. by empowering state governors to unilaterally decide the outcome of elections). If successful, the government will thus be a small-coalition government, and will function very much like a dictatorship (even if it's still nominally democratic).

Why are small-coalition governments more prone to autocracy or corruption? Because leaders stay in power by rewarding their coalitions, and if your coalition is a few tens or hundreds of people, you can best reward them by directly handing out cash or treasure, at the expense of everyone else. If your coalition is hundreds of thousands or millions of people, you can no longer directly assign rewards - instead, it's more efficient to fund public goods that benefit everybody. That's why democracies tend to fund many more public goods than dictatorships.

One of the more interesting parts of the theory is how it lays out the incentives for both the leader and their coalition:

- Leaders want small coalitions
