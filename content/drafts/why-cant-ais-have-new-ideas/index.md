Why can't large language models come up with new ideas? Human polymaths routinely come up with interesting new ideas by combining insights from different areas. But language models have not come up with any notable new ideas, despite being familiar with a far broader range of knowledge than any human. Is that surprising? What's going on there?

I first heard this point on the Dwarkesh podcast. It's a good question to ask AI true believers, because if you think that LLMs have "real" intelligence, the inability to generate new ideas is something that needs to be explained.

AI skeptics like to say that the inability to generate new ideas is inherent to the nature of language models.
