title: What will we do without junior engineers?

In the 2010s, companies were hiring a lot of juniors. This was partially an economic decision: companies were hiring _everyone_, and juniors were a lot cheaper and easier to hire than senior engineers. In 2025, this has mostly dried up. Tech company hiring is much less common and has tilted towards seniors, who are seen as less risky hires. The economic situation will eventually change. But I'm worried about AI.

Frontier AI models are pretty good at software engineering. Fortunately for me, they're not as good as senior engineers yet: they struggle with very large contexts and deep familiarity with specific codebases that aren't in their training data. If you're a strong engineer, you can make better high-level decisions than AI models can, and so add value. I can throw a task at an AI agent and tell at a glance "yep, this is what I would have done", or "no, this is over-complicated, try again like this".

I work with AI models like the chess players of the late 90s [worked with chess engines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_chess): together, we're more capable than either of us would be apart. But I don't know if I could have done this as a junior engineer. At that stage in my career, I was more playing the role of the AI model by working away on problems and occasionally being set straight by my more senior peers. What niche can a junior engineer fill, now that AI can play that role for pennies on the dollar?

One argument is that it's in companies' best interests to hire and train juniors anyway, because there's no other way to get seniors. Tech companies never expected much productivity out of fresh juniors anyway - the point was always to invest in their growth. But the point at which a junior is net-positive, compared to just paying for more AI tokens, is now further away than before. It's now even more of a selfless decision for tech companies to hire juniors, and tech companies are more selfish than they've ever been.
