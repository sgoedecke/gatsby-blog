Amazon infamously has a leadership principle where they say "good leaders are right, a lot". It's unclear to me how useful it is about leaders, but it's definitely true about engineers. Good engineers are definitely right, a lot. 

Bryan Cantrill has a good rant about the Amazon principle [here](https://youtu.be/9QMGAtxUlAc?t=1676). I agree with Bryan that it's a bit silly-sounding, and that it's not the kind of fundamental principle that can guide tough decisions (no problem, just pick the right choice, like a good leader would do!) But I do think it's just a straight-up fact. Good leaders _are_ right a lot. Of course that flows from other qualities: they're smart, or they surround themselves with good people, or for any of a hundred other reasons. I think the point of Amazon's principle is that it's hard to assess those other qualities in the aggregate. It's easier to ask yourself: is this person right a lot?

Okay, it's easier, but still not easy. You can see whether a leader _wins_ without too much difficulty, based on whether users are flocking to their products, whether they're making scads of money, whether their companies are seen as amazing places to work, and so on. But people win for a lot of reasons. You can win by being wrong-but-lucky about one particular high-leverage thing. Bad leaders do sometimes luck into amazing products. The world of business is just too chaotic to assess accurately.

Not so in the world of engineering. Good engineers are right, a lot. They're right about concrete factual statements about how software systems work (e.g. endpoint X has rate limit Y). They're right about concrete plans (e.g. we can't add this check here, but it'll work there). They're right about a million small decisions that they make when they write code, which shows up in their code generally working and causing fewer bugs.

You can assess an engineer based on how smart they sound in conversation, whether they use light mode VSCode or dark mode vim, what their title is, and so on. But if you have the time, it's more reliable to assess them based on whether they're right a lot. For people you work with, this assessment comes automatically: you can just ask yourself whether you feel default relaxed or suspicious when they make claims, or how much of a critical eye you naturally bring to review their PRs.
