I have [delivered](/how-to-ship) a lot of successful engineering projects. When I start on a project, I'm now very (perhaps unreasonably) confident that I will ship it successfully. However, in every single one of these projects there is a period - perhaps a day, or even a week - where it feels like everything has gone wrong and the project will be a disaster. I call this the valley of engineering despair.
