I try not to give a lot of prescriptive advice about working in tech companies[^1]. There are many ways to be successful, and every company works differently. If you're [shipping projects](/how-to-ship) and your management chain is happy, it doesn't really matter how you've accomplished it. However, there's one thing that I do think is solid advice: **you should never be angry at work**.

### The angry software engineer

Well-known software engineering personalities are often angry. It feels unfair to give too many negative examples, but obviously Linus Torvalds' [rants about Linux](https://github.com/corollari/linusrants) are a great example. Some of my favourite engineering talks are from Bryan Cantrill, who is often [visibly furious](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9QMGAtxUlAc) at his subject matter. There are too many well-known angry blog posts to list, but I'll cite one I genuinely like: my Australian blogging colleague Nikhil's post titled [I Will Fucking Piledrive You If You Mention AI Again](https://ludic.mataroa.blog/blog/i-will-fucking-piledrive-you-if-you-mention-ai-again/). Anger is a big part of the general image of a competent software engineer.

Why are so many strong software engineers so visibly angry? The main reason[^2] is that anger often comes from caring about your work, and **caring a lot is sufficient to make you a strong engineer**. I love working as a software engineer in large part because I'm emotionally invested in the systems I build and in the success of my team. When bad things happen at work, getting angry is a natural response. To some degree, I actually think it's healthy for an early-career engineer to sometimes get angry about their work, to the extent that it means they care a lot. I certainly used to get angry - in fact, I wrote about the angriest I've ever been at work [here](/party-tricks)[^3].

### Anger in the workplace

However, **anger in the workplace is toxic**. An angry colleague immediately becomes a problem to be managed, not a professional helping you manage problems. When someone is visibly angry in a meeting or in Slack, it kills the entire atmosphere: many other engineers will often go quiet entirely, not wanting to make the situation worse. If you routinely "get heated" at work, the best-case scenario is that you're part of a tight-knit team of confident people who aren't put off by it. No harm, no foul. But the second someone comes onto your team who's not so confident, or you have to communicate outside of your team, it becomes a big problem.

Healthy workplaces route around anger in the same way that networks route around damaged nodes. Emotionally unreliable engineers will get left out of conversations that might cause them to blow up. Decision-making will get done around them in backchannels. I've seen this become a self-reinforcing cycle: angry engineers aren't consulted on key decisions, which makes them angrier, which pushes them even further away from the spaces where decisions get made, and so on. 

You can often find these engineers bitterly complaining that they keep the company together, but nobody ever listens to them. In my experience[^4], this is almost never true. Engineers who are highly effective tend to get listened to - at minimum by their colleagues, and eventually by managers and product managers who want to extract as much value as possible from them.

### Why I don't get angry

In many ways, my superpower at work is that I don't ever get angry. I've been reorged into dysfunctional teams, have had projects I enjoyed cancelled, and have worked on systems that were extremely chaotic. At worst, I sometimes get a bit stressed - like any human being - but never angry. To be clear, I'm not successfully hiding my anger (unless it's so repressed it's invisible to me as well). Nor am I naturally a chill person. **I've just reached a point in my career where I genuinely don't get upset about work stuff.**

Part of this is that I've successfully become [passionate about delivering shareholder value](/shareholder-value). I've internalized that my job is to _do what the company needs_, so if a project I'm working on is cancelled, it doesn't bother me on an emotional level. I think it would bother me if my colleagues and managers didn't think I was competent, but I still think I'd feel more sad than angry about it.

A cynical person might say here that I've stopped caring about my work, so of course I don't get angry anymore. I've left the side of the "real engineers" - the Linus Torvalds and Bryan Cantrills - and sold out for that sweet, sweet big tech money. I mean, maybe! It's true that I'm less invested in specific technical decisions than I used to be. But I still care a lot about doing a good job, I still ship a lot of code, and I certainly get more done than I did as a more junior software engineer.

### Final thoughts

There's one exception to my rule that I do want to mention: when individual people in your organization are being treated unfairly. I don't think there's anything wrong with being angry when your colleagues are being bullied, or their pay is being lowballed, or they're being laid off without cause. It may not be a _useful_ reaction, but it's certainly a justifiable one.

When I say that you should never be angry at work, I really mean that you should never be angry _about work_ at work.

[^2]: The other (less interesting) reason is that angry posts are more engaging to read, so getting angry is a competitive advantage in the social media landscape.

[^4]: My experience is certainly limited (a handful of companies, and maybe ten different teams or organizations). I can certainly believe it happens!
