When I get together with my friends in the industry, I feel a little guilty about how much I love my job. This is a [tough time](/good-times-are-over) to be a software engineer. The job was less stressful in the late 2010s than it is now, and I sympathize with anyone who is upset about the change. There are a lot of objective reasons to feel bad about work. But despite all that, I'm still having a blast. I enjoy pulling together projects, figuring out difficult bugs, and writing code in general. I like spending time with computers. But what I really love is **being useful**.

The main character in Gogol's short story [_The Overcoat_](https://static1.squarespace.com/static/51734e04e4b08db710716119/t/5405e254e4b0f888a353e730/1409671764783/Gogol%2C+The+Overcoat.pdf) is a man called Akaky Akaievich[^1]. Akaky's job is objectively terrible: he's stuck in a dead-end copyist role, being paid very little, with colleagues who don't respect him. Still, he loves his work, to the point that if he has no work to take home with him, he does some recreational copying just for his own sake. Akaky is a dysfunctional person. But his dysfunction makes him a perfect fit for his terrible job[^2].

It's hard for me to see a problem and not solve it[^3]. This is especially true if I'm the only person (or one of a very few people) who could solve it, or if somebody is asking for my help. I feel an almost physical discomfort about it, and a corresponding relief and satisfaction when I do go and solve the problem. The work of a software engineer - or at least my work as a staff software engineer - is perfectly tailored to this tendency. Every day people rely on me to solve a series of technical problems[^4].

In other words, I don't mind the ways in which my job is dysfunctional, because it matches the ways in which I myself am dysfunctional: specifically, **my addiction to being useful**.

In a sense, I'm kind of like a working dog. Working dogs get rewarded with treats, but they don't do it _for_ the treats. They do it for the work itself, which is inherently satisfying.



[^1]: I think in Russian this is supposed to be an obviously silly name, like "Poop Poopson".

[^2]: Unfortunately, his low status and low pay catches up with Akaky in the end. His financial difficulty acquiring a new coat for the cold Russian winter (and his lack of backbone) end up doing him in, at which point the story becomes a ghost story.

[^3]: I think this is fairly common among software engineers.

[^4]: I interpret "technical problem" quite broadly here: answering questions, explaining things, and bug-fixing all count.


- wanting to be useful
- making things happen
- addiction to being useful

- i love my job

- if your motivation is to Do Tasks, that makes you vulnerable to exploitation
- the main problem is to figure out What Tasks To Do (not to motivate yourself to do anything at all, etc)

- example of another job where it's kind of just exploiting the weird mental state of somebody
- they would do it for free
- working dog?
