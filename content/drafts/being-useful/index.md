- wanting to be useful
- making things happen
- addiction to being useful

- i love my job

- if your motivation is to Do Tasks, that makes you vulnerable to exploitation
- the main problem is to figure out What Tasks To Do (not to motivate yourself to do anything at all, etc)

- example of another job where it's kind of just exploiting the weird mental state of somebody
- they would do it for free
- working dog?
