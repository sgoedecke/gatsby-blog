Some engineers really hate onboarding onto new products. When they change jobs or teams, they grit their teeth through the weeks where they're learning a new codebase, and only start to enjoy their work when they're familiar with the system again. Their ideal job is one where they get to be stewards of the same system for years: enough time to develop truly deep expertise. That kind of expertise is the state of nirvana they chase for their whole careers. 

Other engineers only enjoy work if they're onboarding onto someting new. If they have to work on a single system for more than a couple of months, they get bored. Their ideal job is more like consultancy work: constantly being assigned new systems and new problems, expected to ramp up quickly and make an impact before they're moved to the next area. They exchange the feeling of deep expertise in a single domain for the rush of parachuting into brand-new problems.
