The easiest way to succeed in a large tech company is to do solid technical work over time, relying on the [ratchet effect](/ratchet-effects) to build your reputation. But what if you're incapable of solid technical work?

The first step is to **secure good relationships with your manager and skip-level**. If you don't have technical skills, you won't be able to do this by being a reliable technical resource for them. Instead, you'll have to double down on being _friendly_ and _obedient_. Signal that you're willing to throw your support behind them, no matter what. Take any opportunity to hang out outside of work.

I shouldn't have to spell out why this is so important, but in short: your management chain is not only in direct control of your bonus and whether you get fired, but they're also the ones who control your reputation among other senior management at the company. 

In fact, this is important enough that you should consider switching companies to follow your skip-level and manager (in that order). If you've done a good enough job of being a crony, they should be willing to pull some strings to bring you along.
