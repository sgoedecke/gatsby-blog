What does it mean to get things done? In the abstract, you can complete a mathematical proof or a problem set, but the real world is much fuzzier. Suppose I build a shed in my backyard. Once the structure is up, is that done? Not really. There's always more work to do: clearing the ground around it, making sure it's painted and sealed, keeping the rust away, and so on. Programming is more like building a shed than completing a mathematical proof. Once you write a piece of code, you can keep working on it forever if you want to.

In large tech companies, this fact is a trap for competent but unagentic engineers. They see an infinite queue of tasks that they're capable of doing, and they start delivering a stream of marginal improvements to a particular subsystem[^1]. From their perspective, it feels like they're crushing it. After all, they're putting out work at their top speed: no downtime, no waiting on other teams. But they're not doing their actual job, which is to deliver the most value they can to their company. From the perspective of their manager and skip-level, they're not getting anything done.

What does it mean to get things done in large companies? It means delivering things that are _legible_ to the decision-makers at the company: i.e. your manager, plus 1-3 skip levels, depending on your title. The easiest way to do this is to deliver things that they already know about, such as 

[^1]: In the ideal case, that is. In the non-ideal case, they make a series of changes that suit their personal taste but have no real customer impact.

Getting things "done" in large tech companies

- What does "done" mean? Nothing is ever "done" in the non-abstract world. Everything can be worked on indefinitely

- That's a trap for competent but unagentic engineers, who pursue that queue of possible work forever
- If you want to get things done you can't be a gardener. You have to aim for a bullet-point list of achievements
- So what's "done" mean in that context? It means the company is happy with the state of it
- Declare victory and walk away! Go do something else!

- Philosophy background means I respect social constructs. "chair" is a social construct! just because it's socially constructed doesn't mean it's not real
