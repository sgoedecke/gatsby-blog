Getting things "done" in large tech companies

- What does "done" mean? Nothing is ever "done" in the non-abstract world. Everything can be worked on indefinitely

- That's a trap for competent but unagentic engineers, who pursue that queue of possible work forever
- If you want to get things done you can't be a gardener. You have to aim for a bullet-point list of achievements
- So what's "done" mean in that context? It means the company is happy with the state of it
- Declare victory and walk away! Go do something else!

- Philosophy background means I respect social constructs. "chair" is a social construct! just because it's socially constructed doesn't mean it's not real
