I've stayed for ~5 years at two tech companies. If I'd spent that time working at five different companies for two years each, I'd have seen a lot more different ways of doing things. What new things did I learn after three years that I couldn't have learned earlier?

I can think of multiple cases where I thought a particular rewrite was a huge win for a year or two, but as more time passed it became clear that it didn't add much value. One common pattern for this is a change that clearly makes the code nicer, but in a codebase that doesn't have to be changed ever again - it just sits with no new features for years and then is eventually decommissioned. Another pattern is a rewrite into a cool new library that doesn't turn out to be the next big thing. To really learn this lesson you have to be around long enough for the library to go out of fashion or for the code to be decommissioned.

On the flip side, some changes that seem like mistakes at the time have good long-term outcomes. I'v

Sometimes you don't really understand what happened with a particular interaction until years later. 

I've worked on a team that got completely annihilated - politically speaking - after a particularly bad public incident. In hindsight, there were aspects of the way the team operated that contributed to that risk. For instance, we didn't have an established practice of asking who our highest profile customers were and how exactly they were using our service[^1]. Experiencing the consequences of that after years of things going smoothly really helped me internalize how hard tail risks are to anticipate.
