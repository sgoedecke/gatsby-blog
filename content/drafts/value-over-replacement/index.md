There are two ways of assessing how much value you're providing as an engineer. The first way is to total up all of the code you've shipped and all of the value that code has provided (e.g. how much money it's made). The second way is to try and figure out what _you specifically_ have done that a replacement-level engineer in your place wouldn't have done. In other words, you can look at your literal **value**, or you can look at your **value over replacement**.

I don't think one way is necessarily better than the other. But it's important to be clear-eyed about which method you're using and why. For instance, if you're wondering if you're justifying your compensation, you should be looking at **value**. That's a straightforward calculation of how much money your company is spending on you, and how much value it's getting back. But if you're wondering if you deserve to be promoted, you should be looking at **value over replacement**. It's cool that some code you shipped made 10M in ARR, but if that was normal work that any of your peers would have done (e.g. if you'd been sick), it doesn't necessarily mean you're performing above your level.

How can you measure value? It's easy to know how much money the company is spending on you. The hard part is gauging how much money the company is getting back. If you know how much profit the company is making - and you should - you can try to estimate how much profit your specific part of the company is making, and how much your code is contributing to that. For instance, if you write a signup flow for a new customer segment, and those customers end up being a ~5M/yr source of revenue, you can plausibly say that your value is some reasonable percentage of 5M/yr.

What about value over replacement? That requires guessing at which of the things you did were things other engineers wouldn't have done in your place (or would have done slower). You have to develop a concept of a "replacement-level engineer": the median-strength engineer that could be hired at your level and at your company. It's easy to fool yourself in both directions here - either imagining that your replacement would be a total dud, or that your replacement would be very strong indeed.
