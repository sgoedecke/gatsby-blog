There are two ways of assessing how much impact you're having as an engineer. The first way is to total up all of the code you've shipped and all of the value that code has provided (e.g. how much money it's made). The second way is to try and figure out what _you specifically_ have done that a replacement-level engineer in your place wouldn't have done. In other words, you can look at your literal **impact**, or you can look at your **impact over replacement**.

I don't think one way is necessarily better than the other. But it's important to be clear-eyed about which method you're using and why. For instance, if you're wondering if you're justifying your compensation, you should be looking at **impact**. That's a straightforward calculation of how much money your company is spending on you, and how much value it's getting back. But if you're wondering if you deserve to be promoted, you should be looking at **impact over replacement**. It's cool that some code you shipped made 10M in ARR, but if that was normal work that any of your peers would have done (e.g. if you'd been sick), it doesn't necessarily mean you're performing above your level.

How can you measure impact?
