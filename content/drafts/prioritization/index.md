If you're a senior engineer, it is _your responsibility_ to spend your time and energy on important work. You need to develop a sense of what work needs doing and what work doesn't. In other words, you need to learn to prioritize. I think this skill is the number one difference between senior engineers and junior engineers. Every junior I've seen who could prioritize effectively was already operating at a senior level, as far as I'm concerned. And every senior who can't prioritize effectively isn't doing their job.

Don't be a JIRA ticket zombie! I think a common experience among ambitious juniors - certainly I did this - is to get frustrated at the slow pace of a team and decide "screw it, I'll just burn through all these tickets". On many teams, it's not that hard to do 2x or 3x more tickets than the next most productive person. But this is a dead end. You'll get a pat on the head, told "nice work, don't burn yourself out", and no progress towards a senior promotion.

Everything you could want from a company - promotions, bonuses, internal respect - comes from shipping _projects_, not from closing out tickets. It can still be useful to go through a stage of churning out tickets: to learn how fast you can work, to get rapid familiarity with the codebase, and to build some credit with your colleagues. But at some point you need to transition from doing whatever work is in front of you to prioritizing the work you think is the most important.

What determines importance? Importance at a tech company is **whatever your directors/VPs/C-staff say it is**. I mean that quite literally. Your job as an engineer is to execute on the strategy of the company, and since that strategy is set by executives, your job is to make sure you're aligned with what they consider important. In any remotely functional company, they will tell you (over and over) what that is. You should pay attention when they do.

Try to be ruthless about dropping work that is no longer important. If you ship a project and your management chain begins talking about the next thing, _stop improving that project_. In my experience, continuing to work on an already-shipped project is a very common mistake. Declare victory and walk away! 

The formula for prioritizing is literally this simple:

1. Am I working on the most important thing right now?
2. If not, drop what I'm doing and go do that

You should be asking yourself this at least twice a day. That's the first mistake I see lots of engineers make: not even really trying to prioritize, just coming in every day and continuing work on whatever they were doing the day before, or picking up a new JIRA ticket. 

The second mistake is not having a sense of what the most important thing is. Here's how I figure that out in practice:

1. Is there an ongoing high-visibility incident going on (e.g. directors/VPs are asking about it)? If so, can I help with that?
2. Are there any open questions in Slack/JIRA/etc that I'm able to answer? Is there anyone waiting for a response from my team?
3. For each project that I'm leading, in order of importance: could it ship right now? If not, is there anything I could do right now to speed that up (any code that needs to be deployed or PRs that need reviewing)?
4. For each project that my team is working on, in order of importance: is there any work available to be picked up that would move it along?
5. Are there any tickets on the JIRA board in "ready for work"?

Note that going to the JIRA board is the _last_ step, not the first step. Remember, companies care about projects, not tickets.

If you get this right - if you only spend your time on the most important thing - you can be hugely impactful with much less than 40 hours of work per week. Companies are so full of engineers who work without conscious direction that doing one or two useful things per day will immediately make you unusually productive.
