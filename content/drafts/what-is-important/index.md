One of the most useful things I ever did as a junior engineer was participate in Zendesk's weekly "lab days". This was our version of Google's "20% time" program - the idea was you'd spend one day a week working on something of your choice. The only rule was it had to be at least vaguely work-related: a demo of a new feature, or a piece of code cleanup that wasn't part of the sprint, and so on.

I don't remember what I shipped as part of my lab days. It was probably a series of minor performance improvements, since that's what I was excited about at the time. The real value was in regularly practicing the skill of **choosing what I worked on**.

I think lots of engineers go through their careers without really deciding what to work on. They might speak up for a particular issue in sprint planning now and then, but they don't maintain a mental list of the most important work going on in their team. It's easy to punt that decision to your manager. After all, it's not really your job to decide what projects are important - your job is to execute on projects and speak up for the technical side of things.

This is a big mistake. It's a big mistake because **most prioritized work is low-priority**. At tech companies, the job isn't like assembly-line work where every hour is as important as any other[^1]. It's more like being a firefighter: long periods of pretty chill work punctuated by short intense periods where it's important to get it right.

Tech companies can focus on one or two things at a time. That's because "focus" means "the CEO is actively following up on this", and a single person can only follow up on a small number of projects. Think of it as a spotlight moving over the company. When the spotlight is on one of your team's projects, you had better be willing to drop less critical work and be fully engaged on that project. But the spotlight can only shine on one thing at once - eventually it'll move on.

Engineers who have a good sense for what work is important will recognize the early signs of this process and make sure they're positioned to jump in. Engineers who don't will be knee-deep in other work when the spotlight hits, and thus won't be able to immediately move to the high-priority project. This is bad for everyone:

- Bad for them, because they lose out on the chance to do work that's visible at the highest levels of the company
- Bad for the team, because it means the team has fewer resources to spend on the project
- Bad for the company, because it won't be able to execute as well on the project it's focused on
