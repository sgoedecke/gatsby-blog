When I write about how to act in the company's best interests - about [shipping](/how-to-ship) or [glue work](/glue-work-considered-harmful) - some people call me a sociopath or a parasite. I think that's because they confuse me writing about the goals of a tech company with my personal goals as a software engineer.

**You don't always have to act in the company's best interests**. Everyone except the most dedicated [grifters](/programmer-archetypes) has their own goals that they pursue even when they conflict with the company's. For instance, I try to protect more junior people on my teams from high churn, even when the company would prefer to load them up and burn them out. For lots of people, maintaining a code quality higher than the company's (usually low) bar is in this category, or keeping the UI accessible. All of this is fine! It is completely normal to trade off the company's interests against your own.

However, you should always do that _deliberately_. When you're slowing down a project to make sure that the code is perfectly neat, don't fool yourself into thinking you're protecting the company's interests. You're satisfying your engineering values - your internal sense of neatness - at the expense of the company's interests. You're going to pay some kind of price for that.

I'm pretty open-minded about how people work. There are lots of different ways to approach the job. I have nothing but respect for people who accept negative feedback as the price they're willing to pay for doing what they think is right. But I do have a little disdain for senior engineers who get shocked when they're dinged at promotion time (or recieve negative feedback, or have their project dropped) after prioritizing their interests over the company's. 

Aside from self-interest, why care about what your company wants? I believe you'll just be _better_ at prioritizing your own interests if you know what the company wants and try to fulfil it. Effective engineers build up a lot of credit by shipping, which they can then spend: on prioritizing tech debt work, on giving visibility to other engineers, or anything else. If you don't ever ship, you don't get that credit.

How do you find out what your company wants? You generally don't have to read between the lines. Functional companies will tell you loudly and often. Read the org-wide written communications from your skip-level or above. The projects they give status updates on are important projects. The company wants them to succeed. Likewise, pay attention to where the company is putting its resources. If reorgs are putting more people into an area, it's an area the company cares about.

You could just ask your boss or skip-level, but take what they say with a grain of salt. Unless you have a very strong relationship, your boss will probably be reluctant to tell you that an unimportant area is unimportant, in case you're dumb enough to go saying that publically. Companies change their mind often and quickly. Don't assume that a project that was very important last month will be as important this month. For the same reason, something you've been just keeping-the-lights-on might suddenly become important. You should try and stay flexible.
