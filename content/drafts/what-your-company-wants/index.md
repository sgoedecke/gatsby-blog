Your direct manager and skip may be really nice. But you're always going to be working for at least one powerful sociopath: the company itself. Working for a powerful sociopath isn't always easy, but it is straightforward. If you act in their best interests, you will often be rewarded. If you act against their best interests, you will often be sidelined or punished. 

Large companies are always sociopathic, because decisions are made by the aggregate of a hundred or so executives' work-personas: the most goal-oriented traits of the most goal-oriented demographic of the company. Individual executives are often deeply empathetic people in their personal lives. But they're in the roles they're in because at work they're able to act in the company's best interests[^1]. Thus the company itself has a lot of pragmatism and very little empathy.

### Knowing what your company wants doesn't mean you have to do it

When I write about how to act in the company's best interests - about [shipping](/how-to-ship) or [glue work](/glue-work-considered-harmful) - lots of people call _me_ a sociopath or a parasite. I think that's because they confuse me writing about the goals of a tech company with my personal goals as a software engineer.

**You do not always have to act in the company's best interests**. Everyone except the most dedicated [grifters](/programmer-archetypes) has their own goals that they pursue even when they conflict with the company's. For instance, I try to protect more junior people on my teams from high churn, even when the company would prefer to load them up and burn them out. For lots of people, maintaining a code quality higher than the company's (usually low) bar is in this category, or keeping the UI polished up. All of this is fine! It is completely normal to trade off the company's interests against your own.

However, you should always do that _deliberately_. When you're slowing down a project to make sure that the code is perfectly neat, don't fool yourself into thinking you're protecting the company's interests. You're satisfying your engineering values - your internal sense of neatness - at the expense of the company's interests. You're going to pay some kind of price for that.

I'm pretty open-minded about how people work. But I do have a little disdain for senior, long-tenured engineers who get shocked when they're dinged at promotion time (or recieve negative feedback, or have their project dropped) after prioritizing their interests over the company's. I have nothing but respect for people who accept negative feedback as the price they're willing to pay for doing what they think is right.

Part of the reason why is that you'll just be _better_ at prioritizing your own interests if you know what the company wants and try to fulfil it. Effective engineers build up a lot of credit by shipping, which they can then spend: on prioritizing tech debt work, on giving visibility to other engineers, or anything else. If you don't ever ship, you don't get that credit.

### How do you find out what your company wants?

How do you find out what your company wants, specifically? You don't have to read between the lines. Functional companies will tell you loudly and often. Read the org-wide written communications from your skip-level or above. The projects they give status updates on are important projects. The company wants them to succeed. Likewise, pay attention to where the company is putting its resources. If reorgs are putting more people into an area, it's an area the company cares about.

You could just ask your boss or skip-level, but take what they say with a grain of salt. Unless you have a very strong relationship, your boss will probably be reluctant to tell you that an unimportant project is unimportant, in case you're dumb enough to go saying that publically[^2].

Companies change their mind often and quickly. Don't assume that a project that was very important last month will be as important this month. For the same reason, something you've been just keeping-the-lights-on might suddenly become important. You should try and stay flexible.

[^1]: More specifically, in their own best interests, which in effective companies are closely aligned with company success and profit.

[^2]: It's dumb because "important" and "current high priority" are different concepts, so a claim like "the company doesn't care about accessibility" is both embarrassing and probably false.
