When you sit down to tackle a problem, there is a large space of possible solutions. As you work on the problem and learn more about it, you'll naturally rule out options, shrinking that space. This is especially true when you're working at a large tech company, doing work that would be Any bug can be solved fifty different ways (in theory). 

when you're tackling a problem before you know what to do, you need a sense of what kind of thing might be possible. at a big tech co, this space is relatively narrow in some areas and wide in others. v important to have a sense of what will work and what won't work. for instance, bc you're operating at scale, you might know immediately you can't put a LLM call in the hot path. That constrains the space. You might know there's no appetite for introducing heavy extra libraries into the frontend. That constrains the space. etc.
It's sad to see good engineers waste time by iterating on solutions that aren't in the space
