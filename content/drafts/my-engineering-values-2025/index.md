In 2021, I wrote [this post](/my-engineering-values) describing the kind of work I want:

> A job where reliability and performance is important, at scale. Ideally remote. No tiny startups. No gambling, predatory fintech, or blockchain. I value D&I, emotionally healthy teams, and good management.

What's changed, almost five years later? A lot has happened since 2021.

* Overall, the balance of power in tech [has shifted](/good-times-are-over) away from engineers and towards tech companies.
* I personally went to work for GitHub, where (among other things) I spent two years working on Copilot as it grew from a few tens of millions to over $300M ARR[^1].
* I went through the staff engineer promotion process [for a second time](/staff-engineer-promotions).
* Finally, this [blog](/on-writing) really took off, after [this post](/how-to-ship) - thanks to that, I've now been on [podcasts](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IekJKQ-AvkM&t=1s&pp=ygUNc2VhbiBnb2VkZWNrZQ%3D%3D) and even Australian national [news](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRyb3jA0ZOM&pp=ygUNc2VhbiBnb2VkZWNrZQ%3D%3D)

The biggest change in my engineering values is that **I no longer want to work on maintaining existing systems**. I still love that kind of work, but in 2025 it's just not sensible to try and position yourself like that. Existing systems - even ones beloved by users - are never tech companies' top priority. They're always going to be fertile ground for layoffs and cutbacks. In the 2010s, you could carve out a really good career optimizing and lovingly maintaining this stuff. Now you can't.

Instead, **I want to work on projects that are top-of-mind for company leadership**. Put me under [the spotlight](/the-spotlight)! As it turns out, the way I work is very well-suited to that:

* I like making pragmatic decisions - I feel like this can be painful for some devs, but I genuinely enjoy it
* I'm good at carving out time for myself while under pressure, so (at least so far) I'm pretty resistant to burnout
* I don't emotionally invest in any implementation, so I'm happy to pivot on a dime and keep moving


[^1]: That was a very informative (and formative) experience. I'd love to write about it in another five years.
