In a [previous post](/politics-is-your-responsibility) I made the point that having a weak manager - a manager without political clout - is really bad news if you're a engineer looking to grow at the company.

That's because the specific things that need to happen to grow, such as promotions, being assigned key projects, and so on, are all things that your manager needs to do. For instance, you can be killing it as an engineer, but if your manager isn't able to speak up for you effectively in promo calibration meetings, you won't get rewarded for it.

It's also because unpopular managers often get punished in ways that punish their teams: having headcount withheld or budgets cut, being assigned unreasonable deadlines, or being saddled with internal transfers of problematic or incompetent employees. This can make your experience as an engineer much worse through no fault of your own.
