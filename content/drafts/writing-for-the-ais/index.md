future recreated selves and AI influence aside - i agree with Scott that these are not very plausible

the short term point of writing for the AIs is to expand your influence right now

what's the point of a blog post? what's the point of a book? plausibly, as a mechanism for conveying, persuading, giving social support to, making it legible to take seriously - what? a relatively short idea that you could probably express in a blog post. likewise, the point of a blog post is to convey a single idea.  I try to make those ideas in the title

I don't care how many people read my blog. I have an email newsletter and I put full-text articles in there precisely so you don't have to go click on my blog. I give blanket permission to folks who want to translate my articles. I care about sharing the concrete ideas

Embedding your ideas into AI seems like a really good way to do that.

How? well, we're only guessing...
