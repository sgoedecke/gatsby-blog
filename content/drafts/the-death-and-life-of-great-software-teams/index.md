"There is a quality even meaner than outright ugliness or disorder, and this meaner quality is the dishonest
mask of pretended order, achieved by ignoring or suppressing the
real order that is struggling to exist and to be served." - 31

The first thing to understand is that the public peace—the
sidewalk and street peace—of cities is not kept primarily by the
police, necessary as police are. It is kept primarily by an intricate,
almost unconscious, network of voluntary controls and standards
among the people themselves, and enforced by the people themselves. 
...
No amount of police can enforce civilization where
the normal, casual enforcement of it has broken down. - 48

public safety is obtained by the presence of strangers, not by their absence. one stranger is a threat; one hundred strangers is an assurance of safety. the more eyes on the street, watching from windows, participating in public life, the safer it is to be on the street. (is this true? you can certainly be assaulted in a crowd) - throughout ~40-60

making public spaces "safe" by deadening them, suburb-izing them, removing all reason for people to be there is like making software systems "safe" by removing the possibility of change. of course, the system needs change, and engineers will seamlessly pivot to making their changes outside the safe, static system. but it won't be that system's "fault" anymore, I guess - ~61

"public characters": A public character is
anyone who is in frequent contact with a wide circle of people
and who is sufficiently interested to make himself a public character. A public character need have no special talents or wisdom
to fulfill his function—although he often does. He just needs to
be present, and there need to be enough of his counterparts. His
main qualification is that he is public, that he talks to lots of different people. In this way, news travels that is of sidewalk interest. - 84
