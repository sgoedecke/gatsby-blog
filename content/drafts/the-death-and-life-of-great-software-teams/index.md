"There is a quality even meaner than outright ugliness or disorder, and this meaner quality is the dishonest
mask of pretended order, achieved by ignoring or suppressing the
real order that is struggling to exist and to be served." - 31

26 - the educated man saying "x has all these benefits - but of course it's bad practice, we've got to get rid of it". parallel with too-simple software approaches like single-file codebases, shared databases, monoliths, etc

The first thing to understand is that the public peace—the
sidewalk and street peace—of cities is not kept primarily by the
police, necessary as police are. It is kept primarily by an intricate,
almost unconscious, network of voluntary controls and standards
among the people themselves, and enforced by the people themselves. 
...
No amount of police can enforce civilization where
the normal, casual enforcement of it has broken down. - 48

public safety is obtained by the presence of strangers, not by their absence. one stranger is a threat; one hundred strangers is an assurance of safety. the more eyes on the street, watching from windows, participating in public life, the safer it is to be on the street. (is this true? you can certainly be assaulted in a crowd) - throughout ~40-60

making public spaces "safe" by deadening them, suburb-izing them, removing all reason for people to be there is like making software systems "safe" by removing the possibility of change. of course, the system needs change, and engineers will seamlessly pivot to making their changes outside the safe, static system. but it won't be that system's "fault" anymore, I guess - ~61

"public characters": A public character is
anyone who is in frequent contact with a wide circle of people
and who is sufficiently interested to make himself a public character. A public character need have no special talents or wisdom
to fulfill his function—although he often does. He just needs to
be present, and there need to be enough of his counterparts. His
main qualification is that he is public, that he talks to lots of different people. In this way, news travels that is of sidewalk interest. - 84

throughout - the notion of a Turf, as analogous to teams with strict ownership but no ability to effect change outside of their domain. compare gatekeeper "edge" teams

throughout - part of the point of th ebook is that cities are special because you're always interacting with strangers. this is... kind of applicable to large software companies? plausible that this is the key difference between big and small cos? but also even the biggest software co is much, much smaller than a city. careful not to draw the equivalence too tightly

throughout - the concept of healthy neighborhoods being mixed-use and thus forcing traffic, accidental connection (at least via "eyes"), maybe parallels with healthy teams doing lots of different pieces of work and thus forcing constant interaction with various parts of the company (edge, legal, ops, marketing, different owner teams)? prevents any individual team becoming too inward focused?

130 - good teams are not teams full of strong engineers; bad teams are not weak engineering teams, same with process, etc. teams are organs of self-government

133 - Let us assume (as is often the case) that city neighbors have
nothing more fundamental in common with each other than that
they share a fragment of geography. Even so, if they fail at
managing that fragment decently, the fragment will fail. There
exists no inconceivably energetic and all-wise "They" to take
over and substitute for localized self-management. Neighborhoods in cities need not supply for their people an artificial town
or village life, and to aim at this is both silly and destructive. But
neighborhoods in cities do need to supply some means for civilized self-government. This is the problem.
-- i.e. NOTHING WILL SUBSTITUTE FOR GIVING A SHIT ABOUT YOUR LOCAL AREA

134 - three spheres of self-government. the city (i.e. company policy), then special-interest communities and groups (i.e. networks of influence across the company that care about X or Y), then the street (i.e. the team).
137 - plus the "district", which has to represent the street to city hall (fight, and win!)

144 - streets can only represent their interests well when they work together. must have continuity for that - the anathema of Turf (146)
149 - The cross-links that enable a district to function as a Thing are
neither vague nor mysterious. They consist of working relationships among specific people, many of them without much else in
common than that they share a fragment of geography.
150 - specifically, you need relationships between people from different streets, hop-skip people
It takes surprisingly few hop-skip people, relative to a whole
population, to weld a district into a real Thing. 
152 - Real people are unique, they invest years
of their lives in significant relationships with other unique people,
and are not interchangeable in the least. Severed from their relationships, they are destroyed as effective social beings—sometimes
for a little while, sometimes forever.
-- partly why engineers are not interchangeable - when you lose one, you lose the web of relationships that was tying teams together. too much of this is very hard to recover from.
155 - what makes it easy to form bonds here is not homoegeneity of ethnicity or background, but Time -- "many individuals who stay put."
155 - note that people will stay put only if their team is doing lots of varied things, because people's interests change - if the team is static they will leave
