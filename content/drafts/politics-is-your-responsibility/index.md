When I write about doing politically valuable work in big tech companies, I often get comments accusing me of trying to get ahead at the expense of my colleagues. In fact, the reverse is true. If you're a senior engineer or above, **it is your responsibility to effectively navigate tech company politics**.

The reason is neatly expressed by this quote I saw in David Patterson's great career advice [article](https://cacm.acm.org/opinion/life-lessons-from-the-first-half-century-of-my-career/):

> There are no losers on a winning team, and no winners on a losing team.

The first part isn't _entirely_ true in tech companies - you can have a bad reputation on a successful team - but the second part is true. You can't have a good reputation on a failing team. If your team is perceived as unproductive, that's a bad sign.

Because of that, if you don't "play the game", you're undercutting everyone on your team. In particular, you're undercutting the more junior engineers, which is especially nasty for three reasons. First, they aren't in a position to [ship](/how-to-ship) as easily. Second, they need accomplishments more than you do, because junior positions are up-or-out: you can't sit in them forever like you can a senior role. Third, it's harder for junior engineers to find a new job if your entire team gets laid off or sidelined.

A big part of your responsibility as a senior+ engineer in a large tech company is lifting up your junior colleagues: helping them grow[^1], but more importantly making their work visible to the organization so they can be rewarded for it. You cannot effectively make their work visible if you are not a respected engineer. When you tell managers that a particular piece of work was difficult or impressive, they will believe you _in proportion to your own credibility_.

I get it - it feels cynical to spend your time on your executive team's latest [initiative](/how-to-ship), or to prioritize [projects](/party-tricks) over JIRA tickets, or to avoid [glue work](/glue-work-considered-harmful) unless it's directly helping you deliver. But it's actually far [more cynical](/cynicism) to treat all corporate goals as bullshit and set yourself up as the pure engineer who's the only one who cares about the users. It's the worst kind of cynicism, too: harmful to yourself, and harmful to the engineers who it's your responsibility to build up. 

[^1]: This part is often overstated - in my experience, more junior engineers are usually fast learners on their own, and need political support more than technical guidance.
