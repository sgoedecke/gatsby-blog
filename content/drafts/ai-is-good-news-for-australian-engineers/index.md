Right now the dominant programing model is something like ["centaur chess"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_chess), where a skilled human is paired with a computer assistant. Together, they produce more work than either could individually. No individual human can work as fast or as consistently as a LLM, but LLMs lack the depth of judgement that good engineers do[^1].

[^1]: Of course this isn't true for all domains. If you've been working in the same codebase for ten years, you will be much better at it than any AI system. I wrote about this in [_METR'S AI productivity study is really good_](/impact-of-ai-study) and in [_Pure and impure engineering_](/pure-and-impure-engineering). But for most ordinary big-tech work, where engineers are forced to produce large amounts of impure code to a deadline, LLM assistance can be very helpfpul indeed.
