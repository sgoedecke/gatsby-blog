rked in a satellite office at Zendesk (many american managers), now I work on a mixed team with a US-based manager
why would I do this - better brand recognition, better comp. more global-scale companies available
americans (particularly SF-based engineers) talk like there's an infinite supply of jobs. Not really the case here. Roles in US companies are rare. Forces more competition. Why I'm slightly less idealistic and slightly more tactical. The "fuck the bosses, I'll just do what's right and dare them to fire me" attitude doesn't work so good
You can be fired in the US, but here they can just decide to shut down your office. I saw this happen to other satellite offices and teams. Particularly galling because there's nothing you can do about it. Constant pressure of "is the Australian experiment still seen as valuable"
Timezones! Great for deep work in periods of non-overlap, but obviously hard. You need to be good at driving forward and prioritizing, because your window to get unblocked by others is small. Great at follow-the-sun work (great for investigations/bugfixesÂ (clients love overnight fixes) or when you need to shovel a lot of dirt). On-call too (ish).
Culture is funny. Aus/west-coast American is interesting. Americans brag more, talk more about their achievments, Aus culture is to downplay and laugh it off. There's no meeting-in-the-middle here, you have to learn to talk like them. Still more similarities, must be harder for people coming from cultures further from the US norm. Americans also more prone to believe they're saving the world
