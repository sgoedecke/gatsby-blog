You can be technically strong and still be a weak engineer. One way is to have no [shipping muscle](/how-to-ship). Another is to be 

One caveat: some engineers avoid being wrong by never making confident technical statements. I think this is a dereliction of duty. If you're the most technical person in the room, it's your responsibility - your job - to give information and advice. Always saying "well, I'm not sure" or qualifying all your statements makes it very hard for less technical people to work with you. In any case, the principle is "be _right_ a lot", not "never be wrong". You can't be right a lot if you don't put yourself out there.

To continue that point, there's a difference between "right, a lot" and "always right", or even "often right". In domains that are technically very unclear (e.g. rotted legacy code, or frontier technical problems), being right even some of the time is extremely valuable. In my experience, being wrong is forgivable, particularly if you're the only one stepping forward to offer an answer or a plan.

- it takes courage to put yourself out there and give a clear, confident technical answer
- it takes courage to deploy code that could cause problems
- it takes courage to sit with uncertainty on a hard problem to find the _best_ solution
