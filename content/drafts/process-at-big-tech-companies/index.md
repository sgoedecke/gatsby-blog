I've worked with a lot of different processes. At Zendesk we did fairly strict scrum in JIRA: story point estimations, sprint planning, burndowns, and so on. Sometimes we did sprints and sometimes we didn't. At GitHub I've been on teams that had a variety of slightly less strict Agile processes (e.g. no estimations, or very light estimations and no sprints)

 When to respect channels and when to ignore them
 Respect strategically for work you don't want to do
 Ignore for work you do want to do (side bets, critical work)
 Ignoring repeatedly makes you a target for predators
 Don't ignore repeatedly and then complain about being DMd (your manager will if you don't)
