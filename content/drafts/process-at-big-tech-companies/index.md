I've worked with a lot of different processes. At Zendesk we did fairly strict scrum in JIRA: story point estimations, sprint planning, burndowns, and so on. Sometimes we did sprints and sometimes we didn't. At GitHub I've been on teams that had a variety of slightly less strict Agile processes (e.g. no estimations, or very light estimations and no sprints)
