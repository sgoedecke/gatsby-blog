Software engineers are often like gardeners. They have an image of what "good software" looks like and are happy spending their time chipping away towards it. Senior managers and executives are more like football players. They see their work as a series of moves: short-to-medium term plays that either win or lose. This fundamental culture difference is at the root of a lot of unhappiness and miscommunication in tech companies.

### Satisfaction and hunger

Software engineers are capable of being satisfied. They can look at a product or a piece of software and think "hey, this is pretty successful, we're in a good spot". They can begin to see their job as to keep it that way - in other words, to prevent other people from coming in and screwing it up. In the worst case, this can totally paralyze an engineer-led company (it's easy to think of examples).

Executives are never satisfied. A successful product can always be more successful. For them, user enthusiasm is an opportunity to rush forward and take a big swing at something new. This is partially a statement about the kind of people who become powerful tech executives, but it also often reflects a deeper understanding of the market than software engineers. A tech company that isn't doing new things is in big trouble: with investors, with its employees or potential new hires, and eventually with users.

This difference also partly comes down to incentives. A software engineer who doesn't do much continues to get paid (although this may be changing post-2022). Executives are much more dependent on results: successful launches or programs they can point to. Executives also have a higher percentage of their salary in bonuses and stocks.

When a hungry executive talks to a satisfied software engineer, neither comes away happy. The executive thinks the software engineer is lazy and happy to freeload off a successful product. The software engineer thinks the executive is trying to break a good thing for short-term political gain.

### Goals

Executives always know what their top three goals are. This may surprise some software engineers - it's common to gripe that people at the top of the company are unfocused - but in my experience it's true. They go around all day thinking about their goals. Repeating those goals to other people is a big part of what they do.

Software engineers can go months or even years with only the dimmest awareness of the company's goals. In the worst case, they can pick up Jira tickets or GitHub issues and be sort-of-useful forever without paying attention to the company goals at any point. For some engineers, this is even a point of pride.

One common refrain from engineers is that company goals change all the time, so it's pointless to try and keep track of them.
