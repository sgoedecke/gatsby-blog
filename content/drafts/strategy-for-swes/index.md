Executives always know what their top three goals are. This may surprise some software engineers - it's common to gripe that people at the top of the company are unfocused - but in my experience it's true[^1]. They go around all day thinking about their goals. Constantly repeating those goals to other people is a big part of what they do.

Software engineers can go months or even years with only the dimmest awareness of the company's goals. If they're technically competent, they can pick up Jira tickets or GitHub issues and be sort-of-useful forever without paying attention to the company goals at any point. For some engineers, this is even a point of pride: focusing on the "real work" and not getting swept up in "company politics".

One common refrain from engineers is that company goals change all the time, so it's pointless to try and keep track of them. They do change a lot! The reason for this is that **executives are much more motivated to do new things than software engineers are**. Why is that?

Software engineers are capable of being satisfied. They can look at a product or a piece of software and think "hey, this is pretty successful, we're in a good spot". They can begin to see their job as to keep it that way - in other words, to prevent other people from coming in and screwing it up. In the worst case, this can totally paralyze an engineer-led company (it's easy to think of examples).

Executives are never satisfied. A successful product can always be more successful. For them, user enthusiasm is an opportunity to rush forward and take a big swing at something new. This is partially a statement about the kind of people who become powerful tech executives, but it also often reflects a deeper understanding of the market than software engineers. A tech company that isn't constantly doing new things is in big trouble: with investors, with its employees or potential new hires, and eventually with users.

This difference also partly comes down to incentives. A software engineer who doesn't make much money for the company continues to get paid at around the same rate (although this may be changing post-2022). Executives are much more dependent on results - successful launches or programs they can point to - because of two major incentives.

1. In terms of raw numbers, executives have a _much_ higher percentage of their salary in bonuses and stocks. If 90% of your total compensation was based on the company stock price, I suspect it would change the way you approached your work.

2. Executives are liable to be fired (or forced out) if they go too long without a major success. There are lots of long-term engineers keeping their heads down at any large tech company. Executives can't do that.

Because of all this, when a hungry executive talks to a satisfied software engineer, neither comes away happy. The executive thinks the software engineer is lazy and happy to freeload off a successful product. The software engineer thinks the executive is trying to break a good thing for short-term political gain. In fact, they're both responding correctly to the relevant incentives they're facing.

What does all this mean for software engineers? 


[^1]: Okay, it's not _always_ true. There are lots of executives out there in the world. But in my experience it's pretty universal. Also, by "executives" I mean anything from the C-suite down to the first "strategic" managerial role (usually that's "director" or similar).
