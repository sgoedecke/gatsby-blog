There's a parallel set of concentric circles that track your relationship to the engineers at your company instead of the managers. These are also circles of trust, but it's a different kind of trust. As I'll go on to talk about more, when a senior manager draws on your help, they're putting their trust in you and hoping you won't screw them over. With engineers, it's more like trusting that you know what you're doing - like you trust someone to carry the other end of the couch.

At the center is being the kind of engineer your close colleagues will ping on Slack when they're stuck on a bug or want to bounce ideas around. Next is being the engineer that neighboring teams rely on for cross-team work. At this stage you'll get pinged by engineers leading projects on other teams who want your perspective on how your team's code should interact with their plans. Finally, you're widely respected 

At the widest part, it's easy to hop from one circle to the other. Respect from other engineers helps in building relationships with managers, because managers often ask their trusted engineers if you're any good. Trust from managers can help you get respect from other engineers (if you actually are very good), because that gives you many opportunities to work on projects across the org.


### Being trusted by engineers

How do you gain the trust and respect of the engineers you work with? The answer is simple but difficult in practice: you have to be consistently helpful.

As every engineer in a large tech company knows, coworkers fall into three buckets: net-positive, neutral, and net-negative. Net-positive coworkers are helpful to have around. They drive the work forward: not necessarily fast, but consistently forward. They occasionally create more work through their mistakes, like everyone, but overall they do more work than they create. Net-negative coworkers are a drag on the team. They produce code, but typically either need constant help to do so or ship enough bugs and problems that it's more work cleaning up after them than it would be to just do it yourself. They do less useful work than they create. Neutral coworkers are either complete non-entities - they don't do any work at all - or they're sometimes in the net-positive and sometimes in the net-negative category.

If you are consistently in the net-positive category, I think it is very hard to avoid gaining respect from the people you work with.
