Why does working in a dysfunctional organization make people sad?

The obvious answer is "because it stops them from doing the things they want to do". Engineers like to write code and ship things, and if their company's dysfunction is preventing that, it'll make them unhappy.

It's more complicated than that, though. If that were the case, people would be interested in finding out all the ways in which their company is dysfunctional, so they can work around it. However many people seem to actively avoid that. They find even _contemplating_ the dysfunction to be as unpleasant as actually dealing with it.

I think it's similar to why most people don't like working in a messy room. People - particularly engineers - have a compulsion towards neatness. And like I wrote about [here](/addicted-to-being-useful), it's often our internal compulsions that drive our professional selves. 

Working in a dysfunctional org can feel like the whole world is dysfunctional: 

Before I became a software engineer, I did a master's degree in philosophy[^1]. When you say you're studying philosophy, many people will ask if philosophy can solve their existential angst: they feel that the universe is very big, and that humans make up only a tiny pin-prick of it, and that they feel like nothing matters. Philosophers must have written about that, right? What's the solution?

The solution is to stop doing philosophy. If you think you have proven to yourself that nothing matters, you should refute that by _coming into contact with things that matter_. Go hang out with your kids, or take a walk in the park, or read a good book, or take your medication[^2]. Samuel Johnson famously refuted skepticism about matter by [kicking a rock](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Appeal_to_the_stone).

Philosophy is not there to give you answers to your questions. It is there to baffle you further. If you ever think you understand something well, you can go and engage with the philosophy on the topic to find out all the ways in which you're still hopelessly confused[^3].


[^1]: My specific subfield was "moral epistemology": how we can know what's right and wrong. If you think it's a bit anachronistic for philosophers to believe in right or wrong at all, I suggest reading this [Reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskPhilosophyFAQ/comments/4i2vec/are_there_good_arguments_for_objective_morality/) I wrote a long time ago - moral realism is surprisingly popular among academic philosophers.

[^2]: There are probably 1% of people who are so philosophy-brained that their existential angst does in fact derive from how seriously they take the arguments. These people might benefit from doing more philosophy. Everyone else is just depressed.

[^3]: This is maybe the biggest misunderstanding that laypeople have about academic philosophy. They expect it to be more like science, which does have some "hard answers" - although in my limited experience, those hard answers become nuanced and complicated when you actually get into the scientific detail.

"I hate working in dysfunctional environments. It's like nails on a chalkboard. I have to try and ignore it to function at all, and it depresses the hell out of me when people bring it up"
if you're depressed about philosophy (uncaring world, nothing is valuable) the solution is not to do more philosophy, it is to come into contact with valuable things (sit int he park, be around people you love etc.) a lot of the time it's to exercise _agency_, which is the opposite of sitting around thinking about philosophy
philosophy is not there to give you answers to your questions. it is there to confuse you - if you think you understand something well, you can engage with the philosophy to become aware of all the ways in which you are still confused
if you're depressed about work organizational dysfunction, the solution is not to throw yourself directly at the dysfunction. you cannot fix it. the solution is (maybe) to do something useful. ship something concrete, anything.
if the dysfunction is stopping you from shipping, the solution is usually to work around/with it, not to directly fix the dysfunction
large orgs will ALWAYS be dysfunctional in many ways. it flows directly from the structure/incentives
