A lot of my readers [call](https://lobste.rs/c/ch8tn0) [me](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46085088) [a nihilist](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46082989) when I say things like "you should do things that [make your manager happy](/how-to-ship)" or "big tech companies [get to decide](/bad-code-at-big-companies) what projects you work on". But in fact I think I have a pretty optimistic outlook on what it's like to work in a large tech company. Certainly I'm happy to sit down and start working each day. What's going on here? 

I think Alex Wennerberg put the "Sean Goedecke is a nihilist" case well in his post [_Software Engineers Are Not Politicians_](/https://alexwennerberg.com/blog/2025-11-28-engineering.html). Here are some excerpts:

> I have no doubt that [Sean's] advice is quite effective for navigating the upper levels of an organization dedicated to producing a large, mature software product. But what is lost is any sort of conception of value. Is it too naive to say that engineers are more than "tools in a political game", they are specialized professionals whose role is to apply their expertise towards solving meaningful problems?

> The irony is that this kind of thinking destroys a company's ability to actually make money ... the idea that engineers should begin with a self-conception of doing what their manager tells them to is, to me, very bleak. It may be a good way to operate smoothly within a bureaucratic organization, and of course, one most often make compromises and take direction, but it is a bad way to do good work.

I think this critique doesn't take into account what I'm doing with my writing. Let me try and explain.

### Cynical and idealist ways of talking about work

There are two ways you can talk about work in a big tech company.

The first way is to aim for an **objective-but-cynical description** of how these companies operate. What dynamics determine their actions? Why do they do things that seem counter-productive or inefficient, like frequently re-orging? How can you better predict or explain what these companies do?

The second way is to aim for an **idealist description** of what the mission of a software engineer ought to be. Why be a software engineer in the first place? What good (or harm) is created by our work? What are the _values_ of a software engineer, and how can we act in the spirit of those values?

When I give advice (like "do what your manager wants"), I'm not saying that you have an ethical obligation. I'm saying that doing what your manager wants is a good way to succeed in the workplace. It's up to you what you do with that! **We all have goals other than to succeed in the workplace.** I do things all the time that trade off "succeeding in the workplace" against other goals I have: as an obvious example, not working late to spend more time with friends and family.

In my opinion, **idealist writing is massively over-represented in writing about software engineering**. There is absolutely no shortage of books or blog posts (correctly) explaining that we ought to value good code, that we ought to be kind to our colleagues, that we ought to work on projects with positive real-world impact, and so on. There _is_ a shortage of writing that accurately describes how big tech companies operate.

Ironically, I think that **idealist writing can harm people**. There's a whole generation of software engineers who came out of the 2010s with a _factually incorrect_ model of how big tech companies work, and who are effectively being fed into the woodchipper in the 2020s. They would be better off if they internalized a correct model of how these companies work: not just less likely to get into trouble, but better at achieving their own idealist goals[^1].

Of course, cynical writing can harm people too. **Convincing other people to be cynics is harming them**. It's important to have values beyond just "what will get me more career success", for two reasons. First, your job should only be one part of your life. Second, the whole point of career success is to _use your power for good_: to make your team a healthier environment, to push for products that help users instead of harm them, to help colleagues who are struggling with recognition, and so on.

### Cynicism and capitalist hellscapes

accurate nihilism? in defense of nihilism?

what I write is kind of nihilistic, sure, but I think it's correct. nihilism-as-inoculation: I also think if you don't say slightly-nihilistic-but-correct things, you end up in trouble. if you have no theory for why organizations often ship bad code, you can end up with an even-more-nihilistic wrong theory.
weirdly, it seems like people sometimes treat 'the organization is a hellscape embedded in a capitalist nightmare' as _less nihilistic_. I guess because it still allows you to see _yourself_ as a heroic crusader for the forces of Good and Low Tech Debt?

the "you should value your craft and take a technical stand to improve your product" position is extremely well-represented already
