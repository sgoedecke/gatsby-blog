Everyone loves talking about software engineering talent, but nobody seems to know what they're talking about[^1].  Here's some common ways people think about engineering talent and why they're wrong. But first let me put my cards on the table and say what I think are some true things about engineering talent:

- 

### There's no such thing as talent, just teams

In some engineering cultures, "talent" is a dirty word. It's common to make jokes about "10x" engineers. According to that dogma, engineers don't own software - teams do. Individual engineers are only effective in the context of the team, because it's the team that enables an engineer to succeed. These kind of cultures will talk endlessly about what makes teams more or less effective (psychological safety! good processes!) and never discuss how some individual engineers are more effective than others. I've spent some time working in an environment like this. It was very frustrating for a few reasons

First, everyone who was actually invested in getting stuff done was quietly playing their own game of "shuffle the competent engineers onto my project". But you couldn't actually say "I think this engineer should come and work on X, because it's hard and they're really good". You had to communicate as if it somehow just made more organizational sense for the engineer you wanted to work on your project. There was also the flip side game of this, where 

Moderately difficult engineering tasks became near-impossible, since it was mandatory to break them down into well-documented pieces that even the least effective engineer on the team could pick up and accomplish. That meant either covertly making sure the few hard pieces were picked up by the right engineers, or doing the work yourself ahead of time and then writing tasks like "add this function here with this code in it". The first solution is politically hard, since you can't talk about it; the second is technically hard, because you can't make changes mid-implementation like you would if you were actually doing the work.

In the rare cases where there was a genuine need to
