### Big picture advice

Blog because you enjoy the process of thinking in writing

Try and say things that are controversial, because those things are likely to be interesting

Don't make direct money. The multiplicative value of exposure & interesting conversations (if you have a tech career) is way higher than any direct cash you could extract

My advice - don't use a platform

My advice - don't use LLMs for text

### Getting started

Write a lot, write about things you personally find interesting

Post you own stuff to Hacker News, but don't spam - fine line. Stop as soon as you see other people doing it for you. A tasteful "share this post" link goes a long way.

Have some kind of monitoring so you can tell what people are responding to

Once you get some kind of traction, make it possible for people to subscribe. At minimum RSS but I think it's worth doing email subs (I use Buttondown)

Writing about contemporary stuff is a good way to get some Google traffic. For instance, my reviews of trendy ML papers always get traction on Google because people are searching for the paper names

Don't worry about repeating yourself. Good ideas bear repetition and each iteration will improve the idea

### When you have traction

Don't try to optimize for readers, try to optimize for the kind of readers you want (engaged, smart, good comments). Beware of mass appeal (impressing ppl you don't respect)

You have to be good at dealing with negative feedback. HN is bad, Reddit worse. Don't ragebait but keep putting ideas out there
  - "you say that tolerating some bugs is OK, but I work in embedded software for medical devices so I know you're totally wrong"
  - "you say that people ought to be flexible with the rules sometimes - as a pilot, I know that's false"
  - real comments I have gotten

Don't get in the comments (this is just for me mb)

To grow your core audience, you need variety in content and aggregators. 20 popular posts about AI on HN will mine out the "HN audience who likes AI and wants to subscribe to a blog" space. 1 medium-popular post about something different on HN will give you much more exposure than the 21st banger AI post. 1 post that hits a different aggregator will do the same
