What's the difference between a staff engineer and a senior engineer?

There are a lot of answers to this on the internet ([staffeng.com](https://staffeng.com/guides/staff-archetypes/) is a classic, or [on Reddit](https://old.reddit.com/r/ExperiencedDevs/comments/1iite9s/what_makes_a_staffprincipal_software_engineer/)). These are almost exclusively bottom-up answers: they look at staff engineer responsibilities and behaviour to try and figure out the difference. If you've looked at them, you'll know that there's no consensus.
