I am good at shipping projects. Unless you've worked on a team with me, you're going to have to take my word for it, although you can read my post on [shipping](/how-to-ship) to see if you at least agree with me on the broad strokes. Instead of giving more advice, I'm going to reflect in this post about why I'm good at shipping projects, and why other engineers (many of whom are technically stronger than me) seem to struggle so much. What makes me well-suited to ship: in temperament, in engineering style, and in personality?

### Hedgehogs and foxes

In 1941, Joseph Juran coined the Pareto Principle: that df. In 1953 Isaiah Berlin popularized the idea that "a fox knows many things, but a hedgehog knows one big thing"[^1].

**When I work on engineering projects, I am a hedgehog.** The one big thing I know is that the project has to ship. As the project goes on, I am monomaniacal about this: every conversation, every planning meeting, every PR and PR review is understood in the context of the project deadline and the remaining blockers for the project. I start every workday by asking myself "could the project ship today" and then working through all the reasons why it can't.

**I don't worry about details that won't affect whether the project can ship.** If there's a bug that isn't scary enough to delay the ship or a missing feature that isn't important enough to delay the ship, I don't work on them until everyhing that could possibly delay the ship is taken care of. Some engineers spend a lot of time sketching out things that would be cool if they existed, or future redesigns that users might love. I do that too, but _not when I'm leading projects_. When I'm leading projects, I only know that the project has to ship.

This is not so much a considered position as it is a character trait. In general, I try to make the big decisions correctly and let the small ones worry about themselves. For instance, when it comes to finances I spend a lot of time thinking about increasing or maintaining my main source of income, and a lot of time thinking about big expenses (e.g. housing). I spend almost no time thinking about small purchases, or about making/saving small amounts of money (e.g. rewards programs, clothing).

The downside to this is I consistently leave some value on the table. I probably should use the rewards program at the supermarket when I buy groceries. I probably should spend two days tweaking my VSCode config to be nicer, since for the last five years I've been using default themes and plugins.

### I enjoy making pragmatic deecisions

[^1]: Berlin was talking about philosophers who have a big overarching idea or theory (like Plato) and philosophers who don't (like Aristotle). The line is originally a fragment of the Ancient Greek poet Archilocus. [Who knows what he was talking about.](https://www.jstor.org/stable/636782?read-now=1&refreqid=excelsior%3A28c2e651b431a8e3db40e457c44d4cae&seq=4#page_scan_tab_contents)




### I enjoy making tradeoffs

* I like making pragmatic decisions - I feel like this can be painful for some devs, but I genuinely enjoy it
* I'm good at carving out time for myself even while under pressure, so (at least so far) I'm pretty resistant to burnout
* When I do the first 80% of something, I actually do the first 80%: i.e. enough that you could actually ship it (albeit a little unpolished), not just enough so that the happy path is demoable
* I don't emotionally invest in any implementation, so I'm happy to pivot on a dime and keep moving
