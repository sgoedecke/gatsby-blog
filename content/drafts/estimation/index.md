Yeah, estimation is really hard. I should write a post about this someday - I don't think I'm good at it, but I don't think anyone's good at it.

The point of a negotiable deadline is to make your boss feel comfortable that everything's under control, and to give him a rhetorical tool to make his bosses feel comfortable. You should try and set negotiable deadlines as far into the future as possible, to preserve bargaining space. Typically there's very little cost to overestimating (as long as you don't drag your heels).

I don't put much faith in the 'break everything down and estimate in pieces' approach. Estimates are not determined by the known work, but by the unknown work. The unknown work always takes way longer. So you should estimate based on the number of potential unknowns.

The other thing is that often the estimate determines the nature of the work, not the other way around. If you're working to a one-week deadline, you will make very different architectural decisions than if you've got a five-month deadline. So you don't actually have to say "this is how long the work will take" in advance. You can figure out with your manager how long he's willing to set aside for the work, then try and work out what you can do in that time.
