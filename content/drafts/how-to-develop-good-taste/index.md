How do engineers develop good taste?

There are lots of things we mean when we talk about engineering "taste". Personally, I think taste is your set of engineering values (e.g. how you prioritize readability, scalability, etc)[^1]. Those preferences inform how you behave as an engineer: the kind of code you write, which tools you choose, and how you communicate technically. Given that, the question of how engineers develop taste[^2] resolves to **how engineers develop their values in general**.

### Learning from other people

The most common way engineers develop values is the same way everyone acquires their values - **from other people they respect**. For better or worse, your early-career colleagues (or classmates, or peers) dictate a lot of how your values are shaped.

#### People on the internet

Many engineers my age or younger adopted their first set of values from strangers on the internet. There are no shortage of "cracked engineers" on Twitter or YouTube or Twitch to learn from and be impressed by, each with their own strong tastes. I don't want to name anyone in particular. There's nothing wrong with being a known engineer on the internet[^3]. But I don't think it's great when engineers adopt their values from engineering content creators.

One thing I've learned the hard way in the last ten years is that **you don't know how good someone is until you work with them**. And by "work with them", I don't mean "work at the same company", I mean "work on the same project": reviewing their code, writing code on top of theirs, and in general solving technical problems with them. I have seen people I was _very_ impressed by from a distance absolutely crash and burn when I worked up close with them, and people I thought were pretty unimpressive who ended up blowing me away. I believe this so strongly that I am tempted to just repeat it for ten lines in a row. **You do not know how good someone is until you've actually spent time working with them.**

Well-known engineers might be great! They are certainly technically strong along some dimensions. But that doesn't always translate to being an effective engineer in your current company. 

#### Colleagues

In my opinion, if you're looking for someone to copy, you're better off picking someone you work with. This requires you to be lucky enough to work with strong engineers. I was lucky in my first big-company team - several of the engineers on my team were unusually good, and I had the chance to work with others.

- still, be careful, you only have a narrow perspective
- if you're on a weak team you can't do much

### Learning from your own work

The other way to learn is from your own work:

- learning from your mistakes
- learning from what you worry about
- learning from what makes projects succeed

This is ok, but it's still pretty dependent on your environment and your company





[^1]: I wrote a [long post](/taste) about this, if you want to read more about why I believe this.

[^2]: Note that I don't yet say _good_ taste.

[^3]: I'm a known engineer myself, I suppose, though a very minor one.
