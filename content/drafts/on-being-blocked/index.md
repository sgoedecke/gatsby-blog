A JIRA ticket or GitHub issue is blocked when you can't continue to progress without some external event: another engineer reviewing your code, for instance, or another team provisioning your infrastructure. Some engineers seem to get blocked all the time. Other engineers rarely seem to get blocked. What's going on there?
