[Prediction markets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prediction_market) are a relatively new[^1] idea. They allow people to make cash bets on the outcome of arbitrary real-world events: for instance, the trending bets on [Kalshi](https://kalshi.com/) right now include the next US presidential election winner, the 2025 closing price for the S&P, the Rotten Tomatoes score for the film "Marty Supreme", and whether the Supreme Court will rule in favor of Trump's tariffs.

If AI hadn't suddenly become the most important topic, the 2020s might have been the decade of prediction markets. Many of the same tech-adjacent rationalist-adjacent characters who now write a lot about AI have also written a lot about prediction markets. How could this be as important as AI? Because **prediction markets make quite accurate predictions about the future**.

If you want to read the research on this, you can find a meta-analysis [here](https://iceb.johogo.com/proceedings/2020/ICEB_2020_paper_03_full.pdf). But it also just kind of makes sense. If you see a prediction market bet that you know is easy money, you have a strong financial incentive to take that bet, which shifts the odds towards the accurate side. It also forces **skin in the game**. "Expert" predictions are often made for lots of different reasons: to be interesting, to signal political affiliation, to justify some other position, and so on. But when you have to put real money down, many of those reasons melt away[^2].

One obvious issue with prediction markets is that **insider trading is trivial**. Real markets have _less_ insider trading, in theory[^3], because insiders are already on the company books, and if you're caught you can go to jail. But if you hear a hot tip about the [winner of the 2025 Nobel Peace Prize](https://x.com/polymarket/status/1976434242386317640), it's trivial and fairly risk-free to make a few thousand dollars betting on it.

However, as far as I can tell, **insider trading in prediction markets is a good thing and ought to be encouraged**. The "public good" that a prediction market secures is accurate knowledge of future events. I can go to a [market](https://kalshi.com/) and - without spending a dollar - get a pretty good read on what's likely to happen. The more insider trading, the more accurate that is!

In other words, insider trading in prediction markets fills the same niche as journalists encouraging leakers. The consumer doesn't really care whether it's good _for the journalist_, or even _for the leaker_: what they're interested in is accurate information about topics that were previously secret.

The classic [counter-argument](https://decrypt.co/285857/prediction-markets-insider-trading) here is that insider trading discourages people from placing bets when they don't have inside information, and thus drives away the non-insiders that are needed to make up the market volume. Since the survival of the entire market depends upon discouraging insider trading, prediction markets have to rely on smart predictors instead. This is plausible enough. But I wonder if it's true.

Empirically speaking, markets can tolerate a fair amount of insider trading. Good predictors will still make bets, if they think they're right, and dumb money will continue to be dumb money. Insider trading in the US commodities market only really became illegal in 2010 when [Dodd-Frank](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dodd%E2%80%93Frank_Wall_Street_Reform_and_Consumer_Protection_Act) was passed, and that didn't prevent the market from functioning.



[^1]: Of course, betting on the outcome of events is probably as old as human civilization. When I say "new", I mean the huge popularity of platforms like Polymarket and Kalshi that were launched after 2020.

[^2]: Incidentally, this is why markets _in general_ are a very powerful tool for aligning incentives at scale.

[^3]: I would love to know if this is actually the case. I suspect the real rate of "casual" insider trading in real markets is very high.
