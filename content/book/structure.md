# Dangerous advice for software engineers

or maybe a title that references the good times being over

intro, purpose of the book
audience is primarily more senior engineers, but should be relevant to anyone looking to grow more senior (or learn what that means)
book is NOT about interviewing or being hired, but how to thrive once you're in a large tech company

./dangerous-advice

caveat - large companies, limited experience

## The good times are over

you're probably a senior engineer already - you know how to do the job, obviously. why change? well, the job's changed. habits that worked before won't work now

./good-times-are-over
./in-these-troubled-times

## Attaching yourself to the money

what's the job now, then? you need to attach yourself to profit centers. be tactical

./where-the-money-comes-from
./what-is-important
./party-tricks

## Shipping

the core of succeeding at a large tech company is shipping. if you don't ship nothing else matters

./how-to-ship
./glue-work-considered-harmful

## Engineering mindset

taking a step back, what is a strong engineer like in general? what's the mindset?

./value-over-replacement
./point-person
./what-makes-strong-engineers-strong
./being-right-a-lot
./taking-a-position

## Software design

ok, but how should you _code_?

./great-software-design
./large-established-codebases

## Playing politics

job 1 is protecting your time from other engineers or people (usually PMs) who wil try to claim it

./weak-engineers
./predators
./ruthless-managers

you need to grow your internal reputation

./ratchet-effects

## Using LLMs

LLMs are the other way the job is changing. You really do have to use them or be left behind

./how-i-use-llms

what happens when the LLM fad ends? well, I think "still LLMs" (just maybe less LLM-focused companies)

./after-the-ai-bubble

## Writing (maybe)
